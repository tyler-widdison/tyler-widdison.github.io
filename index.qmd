### Bio

Welcome to my professional portfolio! I'm Tyler Widdison, a dedicated data analyst driven by a passion for finding solutions to complex problems. My current focus lies in data analysis, visualization, and empowering data workflows. I currently work as a data analyst at FamilySearch, where I contribute to the Contract and Compliance team. Creator of the package [ncaavolleyballR](https://github.com/tyler-widdison/ncaavolleyballR). Which allows R users to generate data from NCAA Volleyball. I previously worked with USA Beach Volleyball teams during the Tokyo 2021 & Rio 2016 Olympics where I supported gold and bronze medal winning teams!
