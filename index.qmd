### Bio

Welcome to my professional portfolio! I'm Tyler Widdison, a dedicated data analyst driven by a passion for learning about data workflows and tackling intricate data challenges. My current focus lies in data analysis, visualization, and empowering data workflows. I currently work as a data analyst at FamilySearch, where I contribute to the Contract and Compliance team.

My contribution has been in data gathering and cleaning, implementing ETL processes, and leveraging my programming skills to develop a custom tkinter application.
